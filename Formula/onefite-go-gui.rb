# OFE-GUI for macOS, from this repository's suite release: onefite-gui
# built in advance for Apple Silicon or Intel, with its man page and
# licences. scripts/make-suite-release.sh sets the urls, sha256s and
# version at each suite release. The private fitteia/onefite tap builds
# the same release from source instead.

      Run it with:
        onefite-gui -onefite="#{formula_opt_bin("onefite-go")}/onefite"
      and open http://127.0.0.1:8143 in a browser. From another machine,
      reach it through an SSH tunnel:
        ssh -N -L 8143:127.0.0.1:8143 user@this-mac

      Local runs are not sandboxed on macOS (bubblewrap is Linux-only): the
      same trust as running onefite fit yourself in a terminal.
